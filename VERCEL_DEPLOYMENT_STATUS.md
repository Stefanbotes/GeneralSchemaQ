# Vercel Deployment Investigation Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Investigation:** Why Vercel is building old commit instead of latest fix

---

## 🎯 Investigation Results

### ✅ THE FIX IS IN GITHUB!

The latest commit with the `/api/assessment/questions` fix **HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED** to GitHub.

**Commit Details:**
- **Commit SHA:** `d797436` (full: `d79743692d8ad0139188558849191282a7e61c27`)
- **Commit Message:** "Fix: Resolve build error in /api/assessment/questions route"
- **Status:** ✅ Present on both local and remote (origin/master)

---

## 📊 Verification Results

### Local vs Remote Comparison
```bash
Local master:  d79743692d8ad0139188558849191282a7e61c27
Remote master: d79743692d8ad0139188558849191282a7e61c27
```

Both are **IDENTICAL** - the fix is definitely in GitHub.

### Commit History

## 🔍 What the Fix Contains

The commit `d797436` includes these critical changes to `app/api/assessment/questions/route.ts`:

1. ✅ **Added dynamic configuration:** `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';`
2. ✅ **Changed to shared db instance:** From `PrismaClient()` to `db` from `@/lib/db`
3. ✅ **Removed disconnect:** Removed `prisma.$disconnect()` from finally block
4. ✅ **Prevents build-time execution:** Route now properly handles dynamic data

## 🚨 Why Is Vercel Building an Old Commit?

Since the fix IS in GitHub, there are a few possible reasons:

### 1. **Vercel Needs Manual Redeploy**
- Vercel may not have automatically detected the new push
- **Solution:** Manually trigger a new deployment in Vercel dashboard

### 2. **Vercel Is Caching**
- Vercel might be using a cached version
- **Solution:** Clear build cache and redeploy

### 3. **Branch Mismatch**
- Vercel project might be connected to a different branch
- **Solution:** Check Vercel project settings to ensure it's connected to `master` branch

### 4. **Deployment Settings**
- Auto-deployment might be disabled
- **Solution:** Check Vercel project settings → Git → Production Branch

## ✅ What YOU Need to Do in Vercel

### Option A: Manual Redeploy (Fastest)
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your NTAQV2 project
3. Click on the **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** button on the latest deployment
5. Make sure it says "Building from commit `d797436`"

### Option B: Trigger New Deployment
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your NTAQV2 project
3. Click **"Deploy"** → **"Redeploy"**
4. Or make a small change and push to trigger auto-deploy

### Option C: Check Git Connection
1. Go to Vercel dashboard → Your project
2. Click **"Settings"** → **"Git"**
3. Verify:
   - ✅ Connected repository: `Stefanbotes/NLPQV2`
   - ✅ Production Branch: `master`
   - ✅ Auto-deploy enabled

## 🔧 Quick Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Check if local and remote are in sync
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2
git status

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Compare local vs remote
git log origin/master..master --oneline

# If there are unpushed commits
git push origin master

# Verify remote commit
git rev-parse origin/master
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** and manually trigger a redeploy
2. **Verify** the build uses commit `d797436` (not `943c5fb`)
3. **Check** the build logs to ensure `/api/assessment/questions` builds successfully
4. **Test** the deployed app to confirm the error is resolved

## 📌 Important Notes

- The code fix is **100% complete and pushed** to GitHub
- The issue is **NOT** with the code or git push
- The issue is that **Vercel needs to be told to build the new commit**
- This is a common scenario when commits are pushed but Vercel doesn't auto-detect them

**Status:** ✅ Investigation Complete - Fix is in GitHub, awaiting Vercel redeploy
