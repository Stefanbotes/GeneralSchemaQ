# Persona and Healthy Persona Restoration Summary

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Completed

## Overview

Restored the original `persona` and `healthyPersona` field values for all 18 schemas in the questionnaire data file. These values were incorrectly changed to "TBD" during the question replacement process and have now been restored from the backup file.

## What Was Done

### 1. Problem Identified
- All 18 schemas had `persona: "TBD"` and `healthyPersona: "TBD"`
- These fields previously contained meaningful values that define the schema personalities
- A backup file existed with the original values: `questionnaireData.js.backup_20251021_132811`

### 2. Solution Implemented
- Extracted all original persona and healthyPersona values from the backup file
- Created a Python script to systematically restore these values
- Updated the current `questionnaireData.js` file with the original values
- **Preserved all new question content** - only the persona fields were updated

### 4. Verification
- ✅ All 18 schemas verified to have correct persona values
- ✅ Zero "TBD" values remaining in the file
- ✅ All question content preserved unchanged
- ✅ App successfully restarted with updated data

### 5. Version Control
- Created git commit: `0ad4621`
- Commit message: "Restore original persona and healthyPersona values for all 18 schemas"

## Files Modified

- `/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2/data/questionnaireData.js` - Updated with restored persona values

## Files Used

- `/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2/data/questionnaireData.js.backup_20251021_132811` - Source of original values

## App Status

- ✅ App is running on port 3000
- ✅ Preview URL: https://1571c35e96.preview.abacusai.app
- ✅ All changes are live

## Technical Details

### Restoration Method
1. Extracted persona mappings from backup file using regex pattern matching
2. Applied replacements using Python script with careful regex substitution
3. Verified each schema individually against expected values
4. No manual edits required - fully automated restoration

### Pattern Matching
```regex
variableId:\s*"X.X",[\s\S]*?persona:\s*"TBD",[\s\S]*?healthyPersona:\s*"TBD"
```

### Replacement Logic
- Replaced "TBD" values for both persona and healthyPersona fields
- Preserved all surrounding content including questions, descriptions, and metadata
- Maintained exact formatting and structure of the original file

## Next Steps

The app is now fully functional with:
- ✅ New question content (as previously updated)
- ✅ Original persona and healthyPersona values (restored)
- ✅ All 18 schemas correctly configured

No further action is needed unless additional content changes are required.

If you need to revert these changes:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2

**Summary**: Successfully restored all persona and healthyPersona fields to their original values while preserving the new question content. The app is fully functional and all changes are committed to git.
