# Prisma Client Generation Fix for Vercel Builds

## Issue Description

The NTAQV2 app was experiencing a Prisma Client initialization error on Vercel with the following message:

```
Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. 
This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered. 
To fix this, make sure to run the `prisma generate` command during the build process.
```

## Root Cause

Vercel caches the `node_modules` directory to speed up builds. However, Prisma Client is **platform-specific** and needs to be regenerated for each deployment environment. Without explicit generation during the build process, the cached Prisma Client becomes stale and incompatible with the Vercel runtime.

## Solution

Updated the `postinstall` script in `package.json` to include `prisma generate`:

### Before
```json
"postinstall": "node scripts/prepare-build.js"
```

### After
```json
"postinstall": "prisma generate && node scripts/prepare-build.js"
```

## Why This Works

1. **Automatic Execution**: The `postinstall` script runs automatically after every `npm install`
2. **Vercel Integration**: Vercel runs `npm install` during every build, triggering the postinstall hook
3. **Fresh Generation**: `prisma generate` creates a new Prisma Client optimized for the current environment
4. **Build Preparation**: After Prisma Client generation, the prepare-build script runs to set up Next.js directories

## Testing

Tested locally with a clean build:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run vercel:build
```

### Results
- ✅ Prisma Client generated successfully during postinstall
- ✅ Prepare-build script executed after Prisma generation
- ✅ Next.js build completed successfully
- ✅ All routes compiled without errors

## Deployment

Changes committed and pushed to GitHub:
- **Commit**: `fix: Add prisma generate to postinstall for Vercel builds`
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Stefanbotes/NLPQV2.git
- **Branch**: master

## Vercel Next Steps

The next Vercel deployment will:
1. Run `npm install`
2. Trigger the `postinstall` script
3. Generate a fresh Prisma Client for the Vercel environment
4. Complete the build successfully

## Additional Notes

- This is a **best practice** for all Prisma + Vercel projects
- The fix ensures consistent behavior across local development and production
- No changes to database schema or application logic were required
- The fix is backward compatible with existing development workflows
