## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

### 1. GitHub Account ‚úì
- **What it is:** A platform to store and manage your code
- **Why you need it:** Vercel deploys from GitHub repositories
- **Sign up:** [github.com](https://github.com) (it's free!)
- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/Stefanbotes/InnerPersona.git`

### 2. Vercel Account ‚úì
- **What it is:** The hosting platform we'll use
- **Why you need it:** This is where your app will live online
- **Sign up:** We'll do this together in Step 2 (it's free!)

- **What it is:** An email account that your app will use to send verification emails
- **Options:**
  - Gmail (most common and easy to set up)
  - Outlook/Hotmail
  - Custom business email
- **Why you need it:** Your app sends verification emails to new users

### 4. Credit/Debit Card (Optional) üí≥
- **Why?** Some database providers require a card on file (even for free tiers)
- **Cost?** We'll use free tiers, but they want a card as backup
- **Note:** You won't be charged unless you exceed free tier limits

---

## üìù Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

Your code is already on GitHub at: `https://github.com/Stefanbotes/InnerPersona.git`

**What you need to check:**

1. **Visit your repository:**
   - Go to `https://github.com/Stefanbotes/InnerPersona`
   - Make sure you can see the code files

2. **Verify the repository is public or you have access:**
   - If the repository is private, you'll need to be logged into GitHub
   - Vercel will ask permission to access your repositories

3. **Note down your repository details:**
   - Owner: `Stefanbotes`
   - Repository name: `InnerPersona`
   - Branch: `main` (usually the default)

‚úÖ **Once you can see your repository on GitHub, you're ready for the next step!**

   - If you don't see it:
     - Click "Adjust GitHub App Permissions"
     - Make sure Vercel has access to your repositories
     - Click "Select Repositories" and choose InnerPersona

3. **Click "Import":**
   - Find the InnerPersona repository in the list
   - Click the "Import" button next to it

### 3.3 Configure Project

You'll now see the "Configure Project" page. Let's set it up:

1. **Project Name:**
   - Vercel suggests a name (usually your repo name)
   - You can keep it as **"InnerPersona"** or change it to something like **"ntaqv2-leadership-app"**
   - This becomes part of your URL: `your-project-name.vercel.app`

2. **Framework Preset:**
   - Vercel should automatically detect **"Next.js"**
   - If it doesn't, select "Next.js" from the dropdown
   - ‚úÖ This tells Vercel how to build your app

3. **Root Directory:**
   - Leave this as **"./"** (default)
   - This means your app is at the root of the repository

4. **Build and Output Settings:**
   - Leave these as default
   - Vercel knows how to build Next.js apps automatically

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Don't click "Deploy" yet!**  
We need to set up environment variables first.

---

## üöÄ Step 6: Deploy Your Application

You're almost there! Time to launch your app. üéâ

### 6.1 Initiate Deployment

1. **If you're still on the Configure Project page:**
   - Scroll to the bottom
   - Click the big bg-background **"Deploy"** button

2. **If you've already navigated away:**
   - Go to your project on Vercel
   - Click "Deployments" in the top menu
   - Click "Deploy" button

### 6.2 Watch the Build

1. **Build logs will appear:**
   - You'll see a live stream of what's happening
   - Lines of text will scroll by (this is normal!)
   - It looks technical, but Vercel is just setting up your app

2. **What's happening:**
   - ‚è≥ Installing dependencies (libraries your app needs)
   - üî® Building your app (compiling code)
   - üì¶ Optimizing files (making your app fast)
   - üåê Deploying to servers (putting your app online)

3. **How long it takes:**
   - First deployment: 3-5 minutes
   - Future deployments: 1-2 minutes

### 6.3 Success! üéâ

When deployment finishes, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ **"Deployment succeeded"** message
- üîó A URL that looks like: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- üñºÔ∏è A preview of your app

### 6.4 Update Environment Variables

**Important:** Now that you have your live URL, let's update those placeholder variables:

1. **Copy your deployment URL:**
   - It's shown on the success screen
   - Example: `https://ntaqv2-leadership-app.vercel.app`

2. **Update NEXTAUTH_URL:**
   - Go to: Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Find `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - Click the three dots (‚ãØ) ‚Üí "Edit"
   - Update the value to your deployment URL
   - **Important:** Do NOT include trailing slash
   - Example: `https://ntaqv2-leadership-app.vercel.app`
   - Click "Save"

3. **Update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (if you added it):**
   - Same process as above
   - Update to your deployment URL
   - Click "Save"

4. **Redeploy to apply changes:**
   - After updating variables, Vercel will ask if you want to redeploy
   - Click "Redeploy with latest commit"
   - Or go to Deployments ‚Üí Click "‚ãØ" on latest deployment ‚Üí "Redeploy"

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Step 7: Run Database Migrations

Your database is empty right now. We need to set up the tables (structure) for storing data.

### What are migrations?
Think of migrations like creating folders and filing cabinets in your database. They set up where everything will be stored.

### 7.1 Access Your Deployment

1. **Go to your project on Vercel**
2. **Click "Settings" in the top menu**
3. **Click "Functions" in the left sidebar**
4. **Look for "API Routes"** - you should see your Next.js API routes listed

### 7.2 Run Migrations Automatically

**Good news!** Your app may run migrations automatically on first start. But let's verify:

### 7.3 Manual Migration (If Needed)

If your database isn't set up automatically, you have two options:

#### Option A: Use Vercel CLI (Technical)

If you're comfortable with command line:

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login:**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Link your project:**
   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

4. **Pull environment variables:**
   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```

5. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

#### Option B: Use Database GUI (Easier) ‚≠ê

**For Neon/Supabase/Railway:**

1. **Download your database schema:**
   - Your repository has a `prisma/schema.prisma` file
   - We need to create tables based on this

2. **Use Prisma Studio (Web UI):**
   - If using Neon: They have a SQL editor in the dashboard
   - Run this command in their SQL editor to see the schema:
   ```sql
   -- Check if tables exist
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

3. **Generate SQL from schema:**
   - In your local development (if you have it set up)
   - Or use an online Prisma playground to generate SQL

**Simpler approach:**

1. **Visit your deployed app URL:**
   - Go to: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   
2. **Try to sign up:**
   - If you see an error about database tables not existing, we need migrations
   
3. **Check Vercel logs:**
   - Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Click on latest deployment ‚Üí "Logs"
   - Look for any Prisma migration errors

### 7.4 Automatic Migration on First Access

Your app is configured to automatically apply migrations on first run. To trigger this:

1. **Visit your app URL:**
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app`

2. **Go to the sign-up page:**
   - Click "Sign Up" or go to `/auth/signup`

3. **Try to create an account:**
   - Enter test details
   - If successful, your database is ready! ‚úÖ
   - If you get an error, check the next section

### 7.5 Verify Database Setup

**Check if tables were created:**

For **Vercel Postgres:**
1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Click "Storage" tab
3. Click on your database
4. Click "Browse Data"
5. You should see tables like: `users`, `assessments`, `responses`, etc.

For **Neon/Supabase/Railway:**
1. Log into your database provider
2. Go to SQL editor or Tables view
3. Check if tables exist

**Expected tables:**
- `users` - User accounts
- `assessments` - Questionnaire data
- `responses` - User answers
- `results` - Calculated results
- `sessions` - Authentication sessions
- `verificationTokens` - Email verification

‚úÖ **If you see these tables, your database is ready!**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Verify Your Deployment

Let's make sure everything works correctly!

### 8.1 Test Basic Access

1. **Open your app URL:**
   - `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
   - You should see your landing page

2. **Check styling:**
   - Does the page look styled and professional?
   - Are buttons and text properly formatted?
   - ‚úÖ If yes, your build was successful!

### 8.2 Test User Registration

1. **Click "Sign Up" or navigate to:**
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/signup`

2. **Create a test account:**
   - First name: Test
   - Last name: User
   - Email: your-email@example.com (use a real email you can access)
   - Password: TestPassword123!

3. **Submit the form:**
   - You should see a success message
   - Check if you received a verification email

### 8.3 Test Email Verification

1. **Check your email inbox:**
   - Look for an email from your app
   - Subject might be: "Verify your email" or similar
   - **Didn't receive it?** Check spam/junk folder

2. **Click the verification link:**
   - This should verify your account
   - You'll be redirected to login

3. **If email didn't arrive:**
   - Check your SMTP settings in environment variables
   - Make sure `EMAIL_DEBUG` is not set to `true` in production
   - Verify your app password (Gmail) is correct

### 8.4 Test Login

1. **Go to login page:**
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/login`

2. **Enter your credentials:**
   - Email: The one you just registered
   - Password: The password you created

3. **Click "Login":**
   - If email is verified, you should be logged in ‚úÖ

## üéì Glossary

Technical terms explained simply:

**API (Application Programming Interface):**  
A way for different parts of your app to talk to each other. Like a waiter taking orders from customers (frontend) to the kitchen (backend).

**Backend:**  
The part of your app users don't see. Handles data, business logic, and security.

**Build:**  
Converting your code into files that can run in a browser. Like compiling ingredients into a meal.

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):**  
Automatically testing and deploying code changes. Vercel does this for you!

**CLI (Command Line Interface):**  
A text-based way to interact with a computer. The black screen with green text you see in movies!

**Database:**  
Where your app stores data. Like a smart filing cabinet that can find anything instantly.

**Deployment:**  
Putting your app online so people can use it. Like opening a store for business.

**DNS (Domain Name System):**  
Translates domain names (like google.com) to IP addresses (like 172.217.1.46). The internet's phone book!

**Environment Variable:**  
Secret settings your app needs but shouldn't be in the code. Like passwords or API keys.

**Frontend:**  
The part of your app users see and interact with. The buttons, forms, and pretty design.

**Git:**  
Version control system. Like "track changes" in Microsoft Word, but way more powerful.

**GitHub:**  
Website where you store your code. Like Google Drive but for programmers.

**Middleware:**  
Code that runs before your pages load. Can check if users are logged in, for example.

**Migration:**  
Changes to your database structure. Like adding new drawers to a filing cabinet.

**Node.js:**  
JavaScript that runs on servers (not just browsers). Powers your backend.

**ORM (Object Relational Mapping):**  
A tool that lets you work with databases using JavaScript instead of SQL. Prisma is an ORM.

**PostgreSQL:**  
A type of database. Very reliable and powerful. Like Excel but for millions of rows.

**React:**  
JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Powers your app's frontend.

**Repository (Repo):**  
A project's code storage. Your GitHub repo contains all your app's code.

**SDK (Software Development Kit):**  
Pre-built tools and code libraries. Like LEGO blocks for programmers.

**SSL/TLS:**  
Security technology that encrypts data. Makes "http" become "https" (the lock icon in your browser).

**Serverless:**  
Code that runs only when needed. You don't manage servers; the platform does. More cost-effective.

**TypeScript:**  
JavaScript with types. Helps catch errors before your code runs. Like spell-check for programming.

**Webhook:**  
Automated messages sent between apps. Like notifications between services.
