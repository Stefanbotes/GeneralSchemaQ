# Production Seeding Guide for NTAQV2

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for seeding your production database with questions after deploying to Vercel.

---

## Step 1: Verify Vercel Deployment

### Check Deployment Status
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Locate your NLPQV2 project
3. Verify that the latest deployment shows as "Ready" or "Success"
4. The deployment should be using the latest commit: `5e3c60d` (or newer)

### Test Production URL
1. Visit your production URL: **https://nlpqv2.vercel.app**
2. Verify the homepage loads correctly
3. Check that styling and UI elements are working
4. Try navigating to different pages (login, signup, etc.)

**‚úÖ If the site loads correctly, proceed to Step 2**  
**‚ùå If there are errors, check the Vercel deployment logs for issues**

---

## Step 2: Prepare Environment Variables

You'll need two environment variables to run the seeding script:

### 1. PRODUCTION_URL (Already Known)
```bash
PRODUCTION_URL="https://nlpqv2.vercel.app"
```

### 2. ADMIN_SECRET_KEY (You Need to Provide This)

**Where to find it:**
- Check your Vercel project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Look for `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` or similar
- If you don't have one set, you can use any secure string (minimum 32 characters)

**To set it in Vercel (if not already set):**
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add a new variable:
   - **Name:** `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY`
   - **Value:** Your secure secret key
   - **Environments:** Production (checked)
4. Click "Save"
5. **Important:** Redeploy your project for the new variable to take effect

---

## Step 3: Run the Production Seeding Script

### Prerequisites
- You must be in the `/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2` directory
- The production deployment must be live and accessible
- You must have the `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` value

### Running the Script

**Option A: With Inline Environment Variables**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2
PRODUCTION_URL="https://nlpqv2.vercel.app" ADMIN_SECRET_KEY="your-actual-secret-key" ./scripts/seed-production.sh
```

**Option B: Export Variables First**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2
export PRODUCTION_URL="https://nlpqv2.vercel.app"
export ADMIN_SECRET_KEY="your-actual-secret-key"
./scripts/seed-production.sh
```

**Replace `your-actual-secret-key` with your actual admin secret key!**

---

## Step 4: What to Expect

### During Execution
The script will:
1. Display the production URL being used
2. Make an HTTP POST request to: `https://nlpqv2.vercel.app/api/seed-questions`
3. Send the admin secret key for authentication
4. Wait for the response

### Successful Output
```
üå± Seeding production database...
Production URL: https://nlpqv2.vercel.app

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Questions seeded successfully",
  "count": 125
}

‚úÖ Seeding completed successfully!
```

### Error Scenarios

#### 1. Missing Environment Variables
```
‚ùå Error: PRODUCTION_URL is not set
Please set both PRODUCTION_URL and ADMIN_SECRET_KEY environment variables
```
**Fix:** Make sure you've exported or passed both variables

#### 2. Authentication Failed
```
Response:
{
  "error": "Unauthorized - Invalid or missing admin secret"
}
```
**Fix:** Check that your `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` matches the one set in Vercel

#### 3. Questions Already Exist
```
Response:
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Questions already exist in database"
}
```
**Fix:** This is expected if you've already run the script. The database won't be seeded twice.

#### 4. Network or Server Error
```
curl: (7) Failed to connect to nlpqv2.vercel.app
```
**Fix:** Check that:
- Your production site is deployed and accessible
- You have internet connectivity
- The Vercel deployment hasn't failed

---

## Step 5: Verify Seeding Success

### Check via Application
1. Log into your production site: https://nlpqv2.vercel.app
2. Navigate to the questionnaire section
3. Verify that questions are visible and can be answered

### Check via Database (Optional)
If you have access to your production database:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Question";
```
Should return approximately 125 questions (or the expected count for your questionnaire).

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Script Permission Denied
```bash
bash: ./scripts/seed-production.sh: Permission denied
```
**Fix:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/seed-production.sh
./scripts/seed-production.sh
```

### Issue: Endpoint Not Found (404)
```
Response: 404 Not Found
```
**Fix:**
- Verify the latest code was deployed to Vercel
- Check that `app/api/seed-questions/route.ts` exists in your repository
- Trigger a manual redeploy in Vercel if needed

### Issue: Questions Not Appearing in App
**Possible causes:**
1. Seeding failed silently - check the API response
2. Database connection issue - check Vercel logs
3. Questions seeded to wrong database - verify `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel

**Fix:**
- Review Vercel function logs for the seed-questions endpoint
- Verify all environment variables are correct
- Check that the production database is the one your app is using

---

## Important Notes

### üîê Security
- **Never commit** your `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` to Git
- Keep the secret key secure and private
- The seeding endpoint is protected by this key to prevent unauthorized access

### üîÑ Re-running the Script
- The script is designed to be **idempotent**
- It will check if questions already exist before seeding
- You can safely run it multiple times without duplicating data

### üìä Database State
- After successful seeding, your production database will contain:
  - All questions from `data/questions.json`
  - Proper category associations
  - Correct ordering and display logic

---

## Quick Reference Command

Once you have your admin secret key, use this command:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/ntaqv2 && PRODUCTION_URL="https://nlpqv2.vercel.app" ADMIN_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here" ./scripts/seed-production.sh
```

---

## Next Steps After Seeding

1. ‚úÖ Test the questionnaire flow in production
2. ‚úÖ Verify all questions display correctly
3. ‚úÖ Test user registration and login
4. ‚úÖ Check that responses are saved properly
5. ‚úÖ Review any console errors in browser dev tools
6. ‚úÖ Monitor Vercel function logs for any runtime errors

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Review the function logs for the `/api/seed-questions` endpoint
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Ensure the production database is accessible
