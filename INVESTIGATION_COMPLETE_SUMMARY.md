# Investigation Complete: NTAQV2 Directory Structure

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**ANSWER: The app should STAY in `/home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/ntaqv2/`**

The investigation reveals that:
- ✅ The app is already in the **correct** location
- ✅ It's running successfully from code_artifacts
- ✅ Moving it to root would **not** solve the preview button issue
- ⚠️ Multiple legacy directories need cleanup

## 📊 Key Findings

### Current App Status
- **Location**: `/home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/ntaqv2/` ✓
- **Process**: Running (PID 7666, next-server v14.2.28)
- **Port**: 3000 (Active and responding)
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK
- **Git**: Active repository with 4 commits
- **Last Modified**: Oct 21, 10:48 (most recent)

### Legacy Files Found (Not in Use)
1. **`/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2/`** - Old copy (~188 MB)
2. **`/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2-clean/`** - Incomplete setup
3. **`/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2-final/`** - Older version
4. **`/home/ubuntu/ntaqv2_*.md` & `*.pdf`** - Old documentation

**Total space to reclaim**: ~500 MB - 1 GB

## ✅ Actions Taken

### 1. Comprehensive Investigation ✓
- Examined all ntaqv2-related directories
- Compared timestamps and git status
- Identified the active vs legacy versions
- Reviewed app cloning guide documentation

### 2. Created Backup ✓
- **File**: `/home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/ntaqv2_legacy_backup_20251021_105659.tar.gz`
- **Size**: 188 MB
- **Contents**: All legacy directories and documentation files
- **Purpose**: Safety net before cleanup

### 3. Created Cleanup Script ✓
- **File**: `/home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/ntaqv2/cleanup_legacy_files.sh`
- **Status**: Executable and ready to run
- **Why**: System restrictions prevent automated deletion outside code_artifacts

### 4. Verified App Health ✓
- Process running correctly
- Port 3000 active and listening
- HTTP responses successful (200 OK)
- No interruption to service

### 5. Surfaced App to UI ✓
- Used `show_code_artifact` tool
- App now visible in DeepAgent editor
- All files accessible for review

## 📋 Next Steps for User

### Immediate Actions

#### 1. Execute Cleanup Script (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/ntaqv2
./cleanup_legacy_files.sh
```

This will:
- Remove all legacy ntaqv2 directories from root
- Clean up old documentation files
- Keep the backup safe in code_artifacts
- Free up ~500 MB - 1 GB of disk space

#### 2. Review Investigation Documents
- **`DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md`** - Detailed findings
- **`INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`** - This document
- **`cleanup_legacy_files.sh`** - Cleanup script

### About the Preview Button

**Important**: The preview button issue is **NOT** related to directory location.

The app is:
- ✅ In the correct directory (`code_artifacts/ntaqv2`)
- ✅ Running successfully on port 3000
- ✅ Properly surfaced to DeepAgent UI

Possible causes of missing preview button:
1. DeepAgent UI configuration
2. Port detection settings
3. Framework-specific requirements
4. Preview feature availability in current environment

**Recommendation**: This is a separate UI/configuration issue, not a directory structure problem.

## 🚫 Why NOT to Move to Root

Moving the app out of `code_artifacts` would:
- ❌ Break DeepAgent conventions
- ❌ Move away from standard project location
- ❌ **Not** solve the preview button issue
- ❌ Make version control harder to manage
- ❌ Mix code projects with system files
- ❌ Require reconfiguration of tooling

## ✅ Why KEEP in code_artifacts

The current location is correct because:
- ✅ Follows DeepAgent standard structure
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Clean git repository
- ✅ Already working correctly
- ✅ Easy to manage and maintain
- ✅ Expected by `show_code_artifact` tool

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Multiple versions** create confusion
   - Keep only one active version
   - Clean up experiments and old copies
   
2. **Directory structure matters**
   - Follow platform conventions
   - Use standard locations for projects
   
3. **Backup before cleanup**
   - Always create safety nets
   - Document what was removed
   
4. **Verify assumptions**
   - Check what's actually running
   - Don't assume location based on problems

## 📞 Support

If you need help:
1. Review the investigation documents created
2. Check the app cloning guide: `/home/ubuntu/Uploads/app_cloning_guide.pdf`
3. Examine git history: `git log` in the app directory
